The aim of the course was to familiarize student with ; Errors in summation, stability in numerical 
analysis. Linear algebraic equations: Gaussian elimination, direct triangular 
decomposition, matrix inversion, SVD. Root-finding: review of bisection method, 
Newton's method and secant method; real roots of polynomials, Laguerre's method. 
Matrix eigenvalue problems: Power method, eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices 
using Jacobi method, applications. Interpolation theory: Polynomial interpolation, 
Newton's divided differences, forward differences, interpolation errors, Hermite 
interpolation, cubic splines. Approximation of functions: Taylor's theorem, remainder 
term; Least squares approximation problem, Orthogonal polynomials, Near minimax 
approximation. Numerical integration: review of trapezoidal and Simpson's rules, 
Newton â€“ Cotes integration formulas, Gaussian quadrature; Error estimation. Numerical 
differentiation. Random numbers; Monte Carlo method.
